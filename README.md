# ID-Assignment-1
# Personal Portfolio Site
This website is to give the site's target audience which are recruiters, a better understanding about myself. It is to tell the recruiters a brief description about myself about what I do and what I have done such as my education, programming languages and software I know. The recruiters will also be able to see the past works/projects I have done before to get a better understanding about my experience.

## Design Process
 
The website is for recruiters to consider reaching out and hiring me after looking at my portfolio. This design achieves that by spliting the website into 3 parts, "About", "Projects", "Contact". The About Page will let the user first look at a brief introduction about myself, and move on to see my education/where I have studied at, and lastly my skills. This layout will let the recruiters see my competency to see if they my experience is beneficial to them hiring me. After the "About" page the users can use the navigation tool to go to the projects so that the recruiters can see if my works reach the standards they would want to consider hiring me. After that they can navigate to the contact page to reach out to me by sending a message there and also by the links(email and LinkedIn) provided in that page.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.


## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.
-After completing the navigation header, when I opened the menu in mobile view and scrolled down, I discovered that the position of the header was not fixed so there was a gap in the navigation menu in mobile view. I fixed it by setting the position of the navigation header to fixed.
If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.
